# social-network-API

## Description
This project is a social network platform that runs in the backend through the command line and requires a development platform (such as Insomnia or Thunder Client to be tested). By creating a username and an email address, it allows to add a user to the network, and the options to update or delete it if needed. It’s also possible to add friends to the user, and thoughts that can be updated or deleted too. In addition, the thoughts can have reactions created by another user.

## Installation
In order to use this application, the following packages need to be installed:
`package.json: npm init -y`
`express: npm i express`
`mongoose: npm i mongoose`
As mentioned above, it also requires a development platform to test the results.
 
## Usage
This project needs to be run by the command line, which can be accessed by opening the server.js file in the integrated terminal and start it by typing `node server.js`.  Once all packages have been installed and commands have been run, the user needs to open the chosen development platform and start testing the application by selecting the desired route. If any questions, please refer to the demonstration, which was done using Thunder Client.
